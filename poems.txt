Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun, it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh!

Twinkle twinkle, little stars 
How I wonder, what you are 
Up above the world so high 
Like a diamond in the sky.

Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? 
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full. 
One for the master, one for the dame, 
And one for the little boy who lives down the lane.
