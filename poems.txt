Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool? 
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full. 
One for the master, one for the dame, 
And one for the little boy who lives down the lane.

Mary had a little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Catch a tiger by the toe
If he hollers let him go,
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

I guess doing this is great and stoping here is the best thing.
